PROJECT STATUS REPORT
====================

Status: On Track
The Ascent Employee Compass project is in active development with a comprehensive HR management platform that includes role-based dashboards, task management, course management, and administrative controls. The project has a solid foundation with both frontend (React/TypeScript) and backend (Python/Flask) components implemented and functional.

Key Achievements:
- Complete role-based authentication system with JWT tokens implemented
- Three distinct dashboards (Admin, Team Leader, Employee) with full functionality
- Comprehensive task management system with progress tracking and file uploads
- Course management system with video integration and demonstration submissions
- PDF export functionality for reports and data
- Email system for internal communication
- Leave request and job application management features
- Quiz system for employee assessments
- Responsive UI using modern React components and Tailwind CSS
- Database schema with proper relationships and constraints
- File upload system for CVs, documents, and quiz submissions
- Real-time progress tracking and performance metrics

Challenges:
- Some commented-out code sections in the frontend that need cleanup
- Potential security considerations with hardcoded passwords in the backend
- Database connection configuration needs proper environment variable setup
- Some mock data still present alongside real backend integration
- File upload security and validation could be enhanced
- Error handling could be more comprehensive across the application
- Some UI components have duplicate or redundant code that could be optimized

Next Steps:
- Complete code cleanup by removing commented sections and unused mock data
- Implement proper environment variable configuration for database connections
- Enhance security measures for file uploads and user authentication
- Add comprehensive error handling and user feedback mechanisms
- Optimize database queries for better performance
- Implement comprehensive testing suite for all features
- Add data validation and sanitization throughout the application
- Consider implementing real-time notifications using WebSockets
- Add comprehensive logging and monitoring capabilities
- Prepare deployment configuration for production environment
