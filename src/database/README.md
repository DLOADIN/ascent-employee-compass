# Database Schema for HR Management System

This project uses PostgreSQL as the database system. PostgreSQL is an excellent choice for this HR Management System because:

1. **Robust Data Integrity**: PostgreSQL enforces constraints and data validation rules (like CHECK constraints for roles and departments).

2. **Complex Queries**: The HR system needs complex reporting capabilities across multiple tables, which PostgreSQL handles efficiently.

3. **Transaction Support**: Critical for operations like promoting employees or assigning tasks that need to be atomic.

4. **JSON Support**: Allows for flexible storage of unstructured data like task documentation.

5. **Full-Text Search**: Enables powerful search across employee profiles and task descriptions.

6. **Scalability**: PostgreSQL performs well as the data grows over time.

## Schema Overview

The database is structured around these primary entities:

- **Users**: Employees, Team Leaders, and Admins with their profiles and credentials
- **Skills**: Skills that employees possess
- **Tasks**: Work assignments with status tracking
- **Courses**: Training materials for employees
- **Job Opportunities**: Internal job postings
- **Notifications**: System messages to users
- **Login Sessions**: Track user login activity

## Database Setup

1. Install PostgreSQL 14+ on your server
2. Create a new database: `CREATE DATABASE hrmanagement;`
3. Enable UUID extension: `CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "uuid-ossp";`
4. Run the schema.sql file to create tables and indexes

## Performance Considerations

The schema includes indexes on frequently queried fields:
- User email and roles for authentication
- Task status and deadlines for dashboards
- Department filtering for team views
- Timestamps for date-range filtering

## Backup Recommendations

1. Set up daily automated backups using pg_dump
2. Store backups in multiple locations including off-site storage
3. Test restoration procedures regularly

## Security Considerations

1. Use connection pooling for efficiency and security
2. Implement row-level security policies for data access control
3. Keep PostgreSQL updated with security patches
4. Use encrypted connections for database access

## Integration with Application

When implementing the application layer:
- Use prepared statements to prevent SQL injection
- Implement connection pooling for efficiency
- Consider using an ORM like Prisma or TypeORM for type safety
- Add database migrations for version control of schema changes

This schema supports all the required functionality for the HR Management System, including employee management, task tracking, course enrollment, and the promotion workflow from employee to team leader.
